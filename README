  ~  Juno  ~  
--------------

* Juno is a web framework that was designed to make development as fast
  as possible

* Homepage: http://brianreily.com/project/juno
* Repository: http://github.com/breily/juno


Say 'Hello, World' in Juno
--------------------------

To start off:

] from juno import *
] 
] @route('/')
] def index(web):
]     return 'Juno says hi'
]
] run()

Add some url handling:

] @route('/hello/:name/')
] def hello(web, name):
]     return 'Hello, %s' %name

Use a template:

] @get('/hi_template/:name/')
] def template_hi(web, name):
]     template('hello.html', name=name)


Models
------

] Person = model('Person', name='string')
] p = Person(name='brian')
] p.name                # => u'brian'
] p.id                  # => 1
]
] find(Person).all()    # => [ <Person: id = 1> ]


Features
--------

- All normal web framework stuff (models, views, routes, templates)
- Uses WSGI as a development server, and connects to Nginx/Apache/etc. with SCGI
- Templating through Jinja2
- Database access through SQLAlchemy


Install
-------

* To get the latest stable version, pull from the 'stable' branch.  Then do:

    $ python setup.py install   # As root
    $ python
    >>> import juno             # Make sure everything worked

* To get the latest development version, pull from master.  The same steps will
  install it.

* Dependencies: Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, Flup (for SCGI only)

Help
----

- See the doc/ directory for the current documentation.


Note
----

- Juno violates some usual principles of good design (don't use global
  variables, don't do things implicitly, etc.) for the sake of fast
  development and less boilerplate code.  You've been warned.
