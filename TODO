) Write docs

) For url parameters:
  -- add # and @?
  -- allow unnamed parameters (give default name, maybe 'star' or 'splat')
  -- parameters with the same name become a list, i.e.:
     /a/*:foo/b/*:foo/ => /a/a/b/b/, foo => ["a", "b"]

) Make the HTTPRequestHandler just use the self.headers dict instead of
  casting it to a string and splitting it (why did I do that to begin with?)
  -- Ah I remember why, its an instance of MessageClass which I can't find
     any docs for
  -- Check http://code.activestate.com/recipes/392879/   

) Investigate why dev server takes so long to start up  

) Unescape the GET/POST data to remove url encodings ('+' for space, etc)
  -- Check url above (cgi.parse_qs(), cgi.parse_multipart())

) Any more convenience functions like content_type() needed?

) Clean up the README - too many examples

) Any chance of directory traversal with static file serving?  Initially
  doesn't seem to work '/static/../setup.py' gets transformed to 
  '/setup.py', but check it out

) Testing: specifically, new database types.
