** Juno Basics
==============

    Start out by import Juno:
        
        from juno import *

    
    * Initialization
    ----------------

    Juno includes these default settings:
        
        'mode' => 'dev'         # 'dev' runs development server
                                # 'scgi' runs SCGI server
        'scgi_port' => 8000     # Where the SCGI server will listen
        'dev_port' => 8000      # Where the development server will listen

        'static_url' => '/static/*:file/'   # Anything caught by this route will
                                            # be handled by 'static_handler' (see
                                            # below).  If you change this but not
                                            # the handler function, you must keep
                                            # the *:file wildcard.
        'static_root' => './static/'        # Where Juno looks for static files.
        'static_handler' => juno.static_serve   # The default static handler -
                                                # matches up file requests to the
                                                # directory structure of your
                                                # 'static_root'.  Uses mimetypes
                                                # to determine content-type.
    
        'template_dir' => './templates/'    # Where Juno looks for template files.
        '404_template' => '404.html'        # Filename of template used with the
                                            # notfound() function.

        'db_type' => 'sqlite'           # Default database engine is sqlite.
        'db_location' => ':memory:'     # Default database location is in-memory.
                                        # See 4-models.txt for more information.

    If you don't need to change any of those, you don't need to call init().
    If you do, call init with a dictionary of configuration options:
        
        init({'db_location': 'info.db', 'mode': 'scgi'})

    
    * Suggested Layout
    ------------------

    Obviously this is not enforced by Juno, but my usual layout for it is a single
    file (Juno apps tend to be tiny and thus manageable without spreading them out)
    with roughly this ordering:
        
        * imports
        * initialize settings
        * define models (see 4-models.txt)
        * route shortcuts (assign, etc. - see 3-routes.txt)
        * views
        * run()

    And my directory layout would be:
        
        ./
            juno_site.py
            static/
            templates/


    * Running Your App
    ------------------

    Juno doesn't start either server until you call run().  By default run() will
    load whichever server you have selected in 'mode': 'dev' runs the development
    server and 'scgi' runs the SCGI server.

    It can be inconvenient to remember to change this setting when moving back
    and forth between a development repository and a production repository, so
    run() allows you to set the mode on the command line.  So you can always
    leave it in 'scgi' mode and just do this when developing:
        
        python juno_site.py -mode=dev 
        # Also can be `python juno_site.py -mode dev`
