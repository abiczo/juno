** Using Forms in Juno
======================

    Suppose you have a form:
        
        <form action='/submit/' method='post'>
            <input type='text' name='email' />
            <input type='submit' />
        </form>

    In the view assigned to '/submit/', you can access the form elements using:
        
        web.input()         # => {'email': 'brian@brianreily.com'}
        web.input('email')  # => 'brian@brianreily.com'

    This works the same for all form elements (except for files - right now 
    the `web.input('file_field')` only holds the name of the file, as Juno
    doesn't put the file data in yet.  Thats in progress though.), as well as
    query strings from GET requests.
