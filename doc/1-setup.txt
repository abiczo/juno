** Juno Setup
=============

    * Installation
    --------------

    Juno consists of just one Python module, and is installed with the usual
    `python setup.py install`, run as root.


    * Server Configuration
    ----------------------

    Juno is set by default to run the builtin development server.  The only
    current interface to a real server is through SCGI, which may require 
    adding mod_scgi to your server (Nginx doesn't include this by default, but
    I believe Lighttpd does).  

    The configuration for Nginx should look something like this:
        
        http {
            server {
                location / {
                    scgi_pass   127.0.0.1:8000;
                    include     scgi_vars;
                }
            }
        }

    This would be in addition to whatever other options you were setting.

    After you get Nginx started with that, do this to run your site and keep
    it running after you logout:
        
        cd my/juno/site
        nohup python my_juno_site.py &

    Juno doesn't daemonize, so if you don't run it with nohup it will just 
    exit when you exit.
