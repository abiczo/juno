** Juno Setup
=============

    * Installation
    --------------

    You can install Juno by running `ruby setup.rb` as root.  This puts both
    juno.py and handlers.py into /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/,
    but if your system needs them someplace else just change the INSTALL_DIR
    variable in setup.rb.

    If you don't have Ruby, all the script does is copy the files, I just don't
    enjoy writing Bash scripts.


    * Server Configuration
    ----------------------

    Juno is set by default to run the builtin development server.  The only
    current interface to a real server is through SCGI, which may require 
    adding mod_scgi to your server (Nginx doesn't include this by default, but
    I believe Lighttpd does).  

    The configuration for Nginx should look something like this:
        
        http {
            server {
                location / {
                    scgi_pass   127.0.0.1:8000;
                    include     scgi_vars;
                }
            }
        }

    This would be in addition to whatever other options you were setting.

    After you get Nginx started with that, do this to run your site and keep
    it running after you logout:
        
        cd my/juno/site
        nohup python my_juno_site.py &

    Juno doesn't daemonize, so if you don't run it with nohup it will just 
    exit when you exit.
